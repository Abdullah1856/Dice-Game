A simple dice game for two players, where the goal is to be the first to reach a score of 80. The rules are straightforward:

On their turn, a player rolls the dice to get a random number.
If the roll is 1, the player's turn ends, and it becomes the opponent's turn.
If the roll is not 1, the number is added to the player's current score.
Players can choose to hold their current score, adding it to their main score. This action ends their turn and passes the turn to their opponent.
If a player rolls a 1 without holding their current score, all points in the current score are lost.
The first player to accumulate 80 points in their main score wins the game.
